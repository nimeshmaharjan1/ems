The stack I have used is Next.js, tailwindcss, daisyui as the component library, next-auth for authentication, react-query for data fetching, zustand for the global state management, prisma as the orm and supabase as the database and file storage and some other helper libraries such as react-select and ckeditor.

I have divided the application into two parts  the **admin** section and the **shop** section. The features directory contains the different features present in the application and all the necessary  components and utilities have in stored in their specific folders.
As for the shared components and utils a seperate shared directory has been used.

The credentials for the super_admin is superadmin1 for both the username and password. After logging in as the super admin you will be able to view the cms section of the application that is the /admin/products route.
